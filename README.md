# Week 16 VR Lobby

Dev Diary Day 2: 
Probuilder uv/normal/light problems have been project-breaking, so instead of a fancy shaped space-ship that I worked all day yesterday, I am this time working on an easier, box like shape to put into use what I learned this week regarding lighting. 

Cutting triangular decorative pieces from the wall and applying emmisive materials has also taken a bit longer than I hoped for, due to Probuilder's way of cutting faces in random formations and the hours I had to spend to merge all these mosaic pieces together.

All in all, I am very happy with the way my roof turned out, and the PBR textuers come alive with the emmisive light.

Dev Diary Day 3:

The project for Week 16 is finished. It was a fascinating learning experience and I think I managed to capture the environmental light + directional light at a good angle to illuminate the inside of the lobby.

One thing I have found out during my testing is that everything seems brighter in VR environment than screen.
