# Week 16 VR Lobby

Dev Diary Day 2: 
Probuilder uv/normal/light problems have been project-breaking, so instead of a fancy shaped space-ship that I worked all day yesterday, I am this time working on an easier, box like shape to put into use what I learned this week regarding lighting. 

Cutting triangular decorative pieces from the wall and applying emmisive materials has also taken a bit longer than I hoped for, due to Probuilder's way of cutting faces in random formations and the hours I had to spend to merge all these mosaic pieces together.

All in all, I am very happy with the way my roof turned out, and the PBR textuers come alive with the emmisive light.
